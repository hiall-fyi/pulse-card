# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Visual editor now shows Name and Color fields for each entity — you can set per-entity display names and colors without switching to YAML

### Improved

- Color values, bar heights, border radius, and gap settings in your config are now sanitized before rendering — prevents potential style injection from malicious config values
- Internal code is cleaner — duplicate indicator formatting logic consolidated into a single helper, two near-identical label rendering functions merged into one, and unused legacy function removed
- Editor default values now reference a single source of truth instead of hardcoded strings — less chance of defaults drifting out of sync
- Internal utility functions are now explicitly marked as internal in the documentation

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- Inside mode layout now matches outside mode — name, value, icon, and indicator are properly grouped left/right instead of spreading into equal columns ([#9](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/pulse-card/issues/9))

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- Visual editor now supports more settings — Decimals, Target value, Indicator on/off, Indicator position, Lookback period, Show Change Amount, and Animation speed can all be configured without YAML
- Version number now shows in the browser console (e.g. `PULSE-CARD v0.1.3`) for easier troubleshooting

### Improved

- Visual editor is now organized into three clear sections: Card Settings, Layout, and Display — no more scrolling through one long list
- Visual editor labels are simpler — "Name", "Value", "Icon" instead of "Name Position", "Value Position", etc.
- Cards with multiple entities and indicators load faster — history data is now fetched in a single batch call instead of one call per entity
- Opening external URLs via tap actions is now more secure (`noopener,noreferrer`)
- If the card resource is accidentally loaded twice, it no longer throws a duplicate registration error
- If the editor's helper components fail to load, the editor still works instead of breaking
- Action listener timers are now properly cleaned up when a card is removed from the dashboard (prevents stale callbacks in the background)
- Icon updates now skip empty values to avoid rendering broken icons

### Fixed

- Visual editor no longer writes `animation: { effect: "none" }` to your config when the effect is set to the default — keeps your YAML clean
- Visual editor now preserves `target.show_label` when you edit the target value — previously switching between YAML and the visual editor would lose the label setting
- Entity IDs containing special characters are now properly escaped in the HTML output

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- Gap setting now works when you type a plain number like `8` — it's automatically treated as `8px` ([#2](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/pulse-card/issues/2))
- Card now takes up the full width in Sections view instead of only half — grid columns changed from 6 to 12

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- New `gap` setting to control the space between bars — configurable via the visual editor or YAML (e.g. `gap: 8` or `gap: 16px`) ([#2](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/pulse-card/issues/2))

### Removed

- Vertical bar direction (`direction: up`) has been removed — the feature was experimental and not well suited for a bar card. Use a dedicated charting card for vertical layouts ([#2](https://github.com/hiall-fyi/pulse-card/issues/2))

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-18

- Tap, hold, and double-tap actions
- Charge animation effect
- Entity row mode (for use inside entities card)
- Multi-column grid layout
- Sections view and masonry view support
